<h2> Ingredients </h2>
<p> basmati rice 500g,
500g chicken pieces (bone-in, skinless),
2 onions ,
2 tomato,
125ml cup plain yogurt,
4 cloves garlic (minced),
 ginger (minced),
2-3 green chilies,
1/2 cup chopped coriander leaves,
1/4 cup chopped mint leaves,
Whole spices: 2-3 cardamom pods, 1 cinnamon stick, 4-5 cloves, 1 bay leaf,
1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder,
1 teaspoon red chili powder ,
Ghee or oil for cooking,
Salt to taste <p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>Wash the basmati rice in water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for about 30 minutes.

In a large pot or deep pan, heat ghee or oil. Add the whole spices (cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, bay leaf) and sauté until fragrant.

Add the sliced onions and cook until golden brown. Remove half of the onions and set aside for layering.

Add minced garlic, ginger, and green chilies. Sauté for a few minutes

Add the chicken pieces, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and biryani masala (if using). Mix well and cook until the chicken is half cooked.

Stir in the plain yogurt, chopped coriander leaves, and mint leaves. Mix everything thoroughly.

Drain the soaked rice and add it to the pot. Add enough water (about 3 1/2 cups) to cook the rice. Season with salt according to your taste.

Bring the mixture to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it cook until the rice is done and the chicken is fully cooked. This might take around 20-25 minutes.

Once cooked, gently fluff the biryani with a fork. Garnish with the reserved fried onions, some chopped coriander leaves, and mint leaves.

Serve the biryani hot with raita and enjoy this flavorful dish

Adjust the spices and seasoning according to your taste preferences. Biryani is quite versatile, so feel free to add or modify ingredients based on your liking.<p>/center>
