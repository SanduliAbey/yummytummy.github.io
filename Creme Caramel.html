<h2> Ingredients </h2>
 <p>250ml granulated sugar,
65ml water, 4 eggs,
500ml milk,
1 teaspoon vanilla extract</p>

<h2> Instructions</h2>
<p>In a saucepan, combine the sugar and water over medium-low heat.
Stir until the sugar dissolves, then increase the heat to medium-high.
Allow the mixture to boil without stirring. Swirl the pan occasionally to ensure even caramelization.
Cook until the syrup turns a golden brown color. Be careful not to burn it.
Once it reaches the desired color, quickly pour the caramel into the bottom of ramekins or a baking dish. Tilt the dish to coat the bottom evenly. Let it cool and harden.In a mixing bowl, beat the eggs until well combined.
Add whole milk and vanilla extract. Whisk until smoothes.
Strain the custard mixture through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any lumps.
Carefully pour the custard mixture over the hardened caramel in the ramekins or baking dish.
Place the filled ramekins or baking dish in a larger pan. Fill the larger pan with hot water, creating a water bath that reaches about halfway up the sides of the ramekins.
Bake in the preheated oven for about 45-50 minutes or until the custard is set but still slightly jiggly in the center. Then put this into a freezer and let it four about an hour so it will all set. Then you can serve.
