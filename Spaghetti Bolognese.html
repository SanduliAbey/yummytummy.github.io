<h2> Ingredients </h2>
 <p> 500g ground beef,
2 tablespoons olive oil,
1 onion, 
2-3 cloves garlic,
2 carrots,
2 celery stalks, finely diced,
1 can crushed tomatoes,
1 can tomato paste,
1 cup beef or chicken broth,
1 teaspoon dried oregano,
1 teaspoon dried basil,
Salt and pepper to taste.
500g spaghetti,
Grated Parmesan cheese,
Fresh basil leaves for garnish.</p>

<h2> Instructions </h2>
<p> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet or pot over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and cook until translucent.
Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.
Add the ground beef to the skillet. Cook, breaking it up with a spoon, until it's browned and no longer pink.
Stir in the diced carrots and celery. Cook for a few minutes until they start to soften.
Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried oregano, dried basil, salt, and pepper. Mix well to combine.
Pour in the beef or chicken broth. Bring the sauce to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low. Cove and let it simmer for about 30-40 minutes, 
stirring occasionally. This helps the flavors meld together and the sauce to thicken.
Once the sauce has thickened, taste and adjust seasoning if needed.
Add the cooked spaghetti to the sauce or serve the sauce on top of the spaghetti. Toss gently to coat the pasta evenly with the sauce.
Serve the spaghetti bolognese hot, garnished with grated Parmesan cheese and fresh basil leaves if desired. Serve hot.</p> </center>
